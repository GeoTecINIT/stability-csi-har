## Reproducibility 

### Reproduce online 

Click the on the "Binder" badge above to open an interactive Jupyter environment with all required software installed.

### Reproduce locally
Install Python 3.9, download the repository, open a command line in the root of the directory and install the required software by executing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Reproduce locally with Docker
Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for building an image based on a `Dockerfile` with a Jupyter environment and running a container based on the image.

Download the repository, open a command line in the root of the directory and:

1. Build the image:

```bash
docker build . --tag stability-csi-har-rp
